# CellsAtWork



to build from source (im assuming you are on linux here. If you are windows or mac OS... maybe dont compile from source unless you know how to):\n
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/theskyedoctor/CellsAtWork.git\n
  cd CellsAtWork\n
  mkdir build\n
  cd build\n
  cmake ..\n
  make\n

the executable will now be in the build/src directory.
