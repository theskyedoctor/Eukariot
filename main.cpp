/*Apparently dynamic scaling windows would be a bad idea for a whole bunch of reasons. (fractional scaling and general instability)
I think that's why older games had a dropdown menu for a bunch of different resolutions.
We could probably do dynamic scaling for this project,
but if we were making something huge like Helldivers it might be a bad idea.
also I think some modern games detect the monitor's size once and set it that way. also an option.*/
